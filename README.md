# A Users' Guide to Accessing Microclimate Data

This repository contains R Markdown text for a bookdown site with resources for accessing microclimate datasets. Within chapters corresponding the each dataset, we describe the requires set up and process for accessing data. The materials are complementary to an R Shiny [app](https://github.com/trenchproject/RShiny_Microclim) for selecting microclimate data.

For more information on bookdown, please see the bookdown page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)". You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available [here]( https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html).
